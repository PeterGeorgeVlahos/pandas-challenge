Analyzing PySchool District Student Scores

We were looking over the reading scores and math scores for 15 different school and their budgets in one given school district.

The students rading and math scoring data was sorted and looked over at the district level, the individual school level, the 4 different grade levels, budget level, student population level and school type: district & charter.  

During the analysis, the Top 5 Performing Schools were all Charter Type Schools while the Bottom 5 Performing Schools were all District Type Schools. Viewing the average math, reading and overall score per School Type, confrimed there were significant scoring difference between district and charter type schools.

The in the reviewing Spending Ranges per student, in every range, the schools that spent less money per student had better average reading, math, and overall passing scores.

Smaller Student Populations also had better average reading, math, and overall passing scores.

All in all, if you had a choice, I suggest you find a small charter school inorder to have the greatest chance for good math and reading scores.
